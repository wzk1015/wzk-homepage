I am fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://jifengdai.org/">Jifeng Dai</a>. I obtained my bachelor's degree from Beihang University in 2022, where I was supervised by Prof. [Si Liu](https://colalab.net/people). I also have a double bachelor's degree in economics from Peking University. Currently, I am an intern at [OpenGVLab](https://github.com/OpenGVLab) of Shanghai AI Laboratory. I will be joining UCL as a visiting student in December 2025, supervised by Prof. [Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/jun.wang/). Previously, I was an intern at [SenseTime](https://www.sensetime.com/) and <a href="https://sail.sea.com/">Sea AI Lab</a>.



*I am actively seeking opportunities for Ph.D. visit (self-funded) or company internship globally (e.g. Europe, China, Japan) starting in mid-2026.
